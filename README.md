Implementations of several algotihms and data structures.

These codes should be tested, readable and easy to modify

begining of code includes:
-source of algorithm/link to it
-short summary
-time and memory complexity
-place where it was tested (preferable for algorithms that appear in competitive programming contests, not so for others)
